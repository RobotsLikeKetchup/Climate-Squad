  <h1 id="ourMission">Our Mission</h1>
  <p>We are dedicated to making this world a better and greener place. We have created an innovative green recycling program to implement
    in schools. We have already tested this and improved upon it in schools in New York City. The Climate Squad was originally created by
    a First Lego League(FLL) team called the Veggie Nuggets. During COVID-19, we have adapted and created an online way for kids to reduce,
    reuse, and recycle during the quarantine.
